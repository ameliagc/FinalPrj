Which option for the final project are you choosing -- 1, 2, or 3?

IF YOU ARE CHOOSING OPTION 3, answer the following questions:

* Write 1-3 sentences summarizing what the goal of your project is:


* What are your two data sources? Provide links to documentation or websites you will be getting data from.


* Why are you proposing this project?


* What will the output of this project be? What will it look like, and what information will it contain?


* What are your concerns about this proposal?


-----

THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ARE FOR EVERYONE. (Though they may be easier if you are choosing Option 1 or 2, because you can reference the Option 1 or 2 instructions.)

* What will at least one of the classes you're going to define be called?
Movie


* What will that class take as input to its constructor?
Dictionary that represents a movie


* What will 1 instance of this class represent?
A movie


* What are 3 instance variables this class will have? What will they be called, and what information will they hold? Why are they important?
title: title of the movie
director: name of director of the movie
IMDB rating: rating from IMDB


* Explain 2 methods the class will have that are not the class constructor (__init__ method) by answering the following questions for each. 
ONE METHOD:
- What will the name of the method be?
__str__

- What will the method do?
The method will format how to print out a movie title as a string

- Will it take any additional input? 
No

- Will it return anything? Should it change anything about the instance/an instance variable? 
It will return a string of information from the class

- Why is it useful for this class definition, in this program?
This is useful because we will need to print out the summary stats to a text file where we list the three movie titles.


ANOTHER METHOD:
- What will the name of the method be?
num_languages

- What will the method do?
This method will get the number of languages the movie has

- Will it take any additional input? 
No

- Will it return anything? Should it change anything about the instance/an instance variable? 
It will return a the number of languages in the movie

- Why is it useful for this class definition, in this program?
This is useful because you need the number of languages in the Movies database table

[If you definitely want to have a third, feel free to answer those questions a third time, because you'll have to do so eventually. when you write documentation!]


* What will the tables in your database be?
The tables will be Tweets, Users, and Movies


* What fields will each database table have? Which field of them is the primary key? You should list the fields for each database table here, e.g.
Tweets:
- text ... 
(etc.)
Tweets:
- tweet_text
- tweet ID (primary key)
- user who posted the tweet
- movie search term this tweet came from
- number of favorites
- number of retweets

Users:
- user ID (primary key)
- user screen name
- number of favorites that user has ever made

Movies:
- ID (primary key)
- title of the movie
- director of the movie
- number of languages
- IMDB rating
- first actor in list


* List, in English, 2 queries you'll want to make from your database. At least one should be a JOIN. You can always change these later, but start with  ideas you're interested in and lessen the work on yourself later on! 
(e.g. from class examples, maybe "I want to make a query that accesses the numbers of times each user has favorited tweets, and the number of times tweets that user posted have been favorited -- so I'll be joining the Tweets table and the Users table")

Query #1: I want to make a query that accesses the IMDB rating of movies that have more than 1 language

Query #2: I want to make a query that accesses the IMDB rating and number of times a tweet about a movie has been favorited so I'll be joining the Tweets table and Movies table. 


* What are at least 2 of the data processing mechanics you're planning to use? 

Set comprehension, dictionary comprehension


* Why will each of those be useful to you? What data might you use it on? 
(e.g. "Set comprehension: I think I'm going to be looking for unique names and proper nouns in this big set of text, so I'm going to use a set comprehension"). 
>>>This is especially important if you are doing Option 3, but it's important for everyone!<<<

I'm planning to use a set comprehension for the first query when I just need a list of ratings that I will get by looping through data for each movie. 
I'm planning to use a dictionary comprehension for the key-value pair in query 2 between the movie rating and the number of favorites for tweets that mention that movie.


* What will your output look like? Will it be a .txt file? a CSV file? something else? What information will it contain? >>>This is especially important if you are doing Option 3, but it's important for everyone!<<<

My output will be a database and a text file that has summary statistics that contains movie titles and information for tweets that mention those movies.
